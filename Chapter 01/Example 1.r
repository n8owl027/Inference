#Example: On a typical day a certain manager wants to know the average number of
#sales calls of his sales representatives make per day. He took a random sample of 8
#from a total of 20 representatives and collects the data from them. The obtained data
#are in the following table.
x<-c(4,3,2,5,3,3,1,5)
fre<-sum(x)
n<-8
PI<-round(fre/n,2)
