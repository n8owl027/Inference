## Confidence Interval for a Population Mean

## Situation 1

- Normally distributed population 

- Population variance (σ) is known

## Situation 2

- Non-normally distributed population

- Population variance (σ) is known or unknown
 
- Large in sample size

## Situation 3

- Population variance is unknown

- Population mean is unknown 

- Small in sample size
